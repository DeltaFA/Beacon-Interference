# Beacon Rebalance [Δ]
Makes beacons stronger at the cost of introducing the Beacon Overload mechanic.

A standalone part of the Delta [Δ] Overhaul.

# Rebalance
By default the changed values are:

- Module slot ammount: 2 -> 10
- Supply area distance: 3 -> 10
- Distribution effectivity: 1.5 -> 1
	- Each Quality level still adds a +0.2 bonus 
- Power draw: 480kW -> 2MW

All changes except power draw can be modified via Startup Settings.

# Beacon Overload
Any machine that is affected by more than one Beacon will become overloaded, preventing it from working.
